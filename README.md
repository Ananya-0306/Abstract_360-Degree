Abstract 360-Degree Fractal Tree pattern Using Python Turtle Graphics
A Fractal is a curve or geometrical figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. They are useful in modeling structures (such as snowflakes) in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and in describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth and galaxy formation. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, nerve cells, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc. Abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over.

This is a code to create an abstract 360-degree Fractal tree pattern (A fractal tree is known as a tree which can be created by recursively symmetrical branching) using recursion and Python Turtle Graphics.
